***********
DESCRIPTION
***********


This tool is part of the cifs-utils suite.

\ **cifs.upcall**\  is a userspace helper program for the linux CIFS client
filesystem. There are a number of activities that the kernel cannot
easily do itself. This program is a callout program that does these
things for the kernel and then returns the result.

\ **cifs.upcall**\  is generally intended to be run when the kernel calls
request-key(8) for a particular key type. While it can be run
directly from the command-line, it's not generally intended to be run
that way.


*******
OPTIONS
*******



\ **-c**\ 
 
 This option is deprecated and is currently ignored.
 


\ **--no-env-probe|-E**\ 
 
 Normally, \ **cifs.upcall**\  will probe the environment variable space of
 the process that initiated the upcall in order to fetch the value of
 \ ``$KRB5CCNAME``\ . This can assist the program with finding credential
 caches in non-default locations. If this option is set, then the
 program won't do this and will rely on finding credcaches in the
 default locations specified in \ *krb5.conf*\ . Note that this is never
 performed when the uid is 0. The default credcache location is always
 used when the uid is 0, regardless of the environment variable setting
 in the process.
 


\ **--krb5conf|-k=/path/to/krb5.conf**\ 
 
 This option allows administrators to set an alternate location for the
 \ *krb5.conf*\  file that \ **cifs.upcall**\  will use.
 


\ **--keytab=|-K=/path/to/keytab**\ 
 
 This option allows administrators to specify a keytab file to be
 used. When a user has no credential cache already established,
 \ **cifs.upcall**\  will attempt to use this keytab to acquire them. The
 default is the system-wide keytab \ */etc/krb5.keytab*\ .
 


\ **--trust-dns|-t**\ 
 
 With krb5 upcalls, the name used as the host portion of the service
 principal defaults to the hostname portion of the UNC. This option
 allows the upcall program to reverse resolve the network address of
 the server in order to get the hostname.
 
 This is less secure than not trusting DNS. When using this option,
 it's possible that an attacker could get control of DNS and trick the
 client into mounting a different server altogether. It's preferable to
 instead add server principals to the KDC for every possible hostname,
 but this option exists for cases where that isn't possible. The
 default is to not trust reverse hostname lookups in this fashion.
 


\ **--legacy-uid|-l**\ 
 
 Traditionally, the kernel has sent only a single uid= parameter to the
 upcall for the SPNEGO upcall that's used to determine what user's
 credential cache to use.  This parameter is affected by the \ **uid=**\ 
 mount option, which also governs the ownership of files on the mount.
 
 Newer kernels send a creduid= option as well, which contains what uid
 it thinks actually owns the credentials that it's looking for. At
 mount time, this is generally set to the real uid of the user doing
 the mount. For multisession mounts, it's set to the fsuid of the mount
 user. Set this option if you want cifs.upcall to use the older \ **uid=**\ 
 parameter instead of the creduid= parameter.
 


\ **--version|-v**\ 
 
 Print version number and exit.
 



************************
CONFIGURATION FOR KEYCTL
************************


\ **cifs.upcall**\  is designed to be called from the kernel via the
request-key callout program. This requires that request-key be told
where and how to call this program.  The current \ **cifs.upcall**\ 
program handles two different key types:


\ **cifs.spnego**\ 
 
 This keytype is for retrieving kerberos session keys
 


\ **dns_resolver**\ 
 
 This key type is for resolving hostnames into IP addresses. Support
 for this key type may eventually be deprecated (see below).
 
 To make this program useful for CIFS, you'll need to set up entries
 for them in request-key.conf(5). Here's an example of an entry for
 each key type:
 
 
 .. code-block:: perl
 
      #OPERATION  TYPE           D C PROGRAM ARG1 ARG2...
      #=========  =============  = = ================================
      create      cifs.spnego    * * @sbindir@/cifs.upcall %k
      create      dns_resolver   * * @sbindir@/cifs.upcall %k
 
 
 See request-key.conf(5) for more info on each field.
 
 The keyutils package has also started including a dns_resolver
 handling program as well that is preferred over the one in
 \ **cifs.upcall.**\  If you are using a keyutils version equal to or
 greater than 1.5, you should use \ ``key.dns_resolver``\  to handle the
 \ ``dns_resolver``\  keytype instead of \ **cifs.upcall**\ . See
 key.dns_resolver(8) for more info.
