SYNOPSIS
********

  cifscreds add|clear|clearall|update [-u username] [-d] host|domain [-t timeout]

***********
DESCRIPTION
***********

The ``cifscreds``  program is a tool for managing credentials (username
and password) for the purpose of establishing sessions in multiuser
mounts.

When a cifs filesystem is mounted with the "multiuser" option, and does
not use krb5 authentication, it needs to be able to get the credentials
for each user from somewhere. The ``cifscreds`` program is the tool used
to provide these credentials to the kernel.

The first non-option argument to cifscreds is a command (see the
`COMMANDS`_  section below). The second non-option argument is a hostname
or address, or an NT domain name.

********
COMMANDS
********

add
  Add credentials to the kernel to be used for connecting to the given
  server, or servers in the given domain.

clear
  Clear credentials for a particular host or domain from the kernel.

clearall
  Clear all cifs credentials from the kernel.

update
  Update stored credentials in the kernel with a new username and
  password.

*******
OPTIONS
*******

-d, --domain
  The provided host/domain argument is a NT domainname.

  Ordinarily the second argument provided to cifscreds is treated as a
  hostname or IP address. This option causes the cifscreds program to
  treat that argument as an NT domainname instead.

  If there are not host specific credentials for the mounted server, then
  the kernel will next look for a set of domain credentials equivalent to
  the domain= option provided at mount time.

-u, --username
  Ordinarily, the username is derived from the unix username of the user
  adding the credentials. This option allows the user to substitute a
  different username.

-t, --timeout
  Sets the key timeout in seconds. If not set, will use the system default
  timeout for logon keys.

*****
NOTES
*****

The cifscreds utility requires a kernel built with support for the
``login`` key type. That key type was added in v3.3 in mainline Linux
kernels.

Since ``cifscreds`` adds keys to the session keyring, it is highly
recommended that one use ``pam_keyinit`` to ensure that a session keyring
is established at login time.
